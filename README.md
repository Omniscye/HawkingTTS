# HawkingTTS v1.0.0
Make your TTS sound like Stephen Hawking. Classic talking computer style, crispy and funny. No AI clone, this is the real DECtalk.

## What it does
- Replaces your in game TTS with DECtalk voices like Paul and Wendy
- Works in lobbies so everyone hears you if they have the mod.
- Optional whisper on crouch for sneaky lines

## What is included
- HawkingTTS.dll - the mod
- 80speak DECtalk engine binaries - bundled in the Thunderstore package so you get the real voice out of the box
- Simple config so you can switch voices and options

## How to use
Talk like normal. Your TTS now has the Stephen Hawking style. To change voice, open the config file in `BepInEx/config/`.
